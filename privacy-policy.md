# Privacy Policy of CoCeMoCl aka GeoClient App

The GeoClient app is a tool to send the collected location data to a server of the choice of the user.
The destination to send the data to is configured by scanning a QR code in the app.
It is the responsibility of the user to scan only trusted QR codes.

The app sends the location continously in the background to provide a live feed of the movements of the device.
The user fully controls sending the location data, by
* starting it by scanning a QR code
* stopping it by unregistering the device in the "settings" tab
* stopping the location transmission latest after 24 hours after registration as safety net if the unregister action was forgotten

Summary:

* The app does not store or process the location data.
* The location information is only sent to the destination the user configures via the scanned QR code.
